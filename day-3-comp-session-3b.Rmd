```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
# Create a vector 
vec_a <- c(4, 5)

```

Adding Another Code Chunk to practice the echo settings. 
echo = TRUE means it will be printed in the knit, echo = FALSE means it will not be printed. 
To make echo = FALSE in the code chunk,  
it would look like this: 
{r, echo= FALSE} and the code would not show in the knit

```{r}

vec_b <- c(-3, 10)

```

### Vector Addition

```{r}
vec_c <- vec_a + vec_b

```

### Vector Subtraction 

```{r}
vec_d <- vec_b - vec_a
```

### Vector Scalar Multiplication 

```{r}
vec_e = 4 * vec_b
```

### Vector Dot Product 

```{r}
# If we use the asterisk to try dot product: 
vec_a * vec_b

#The dot product actually is:

vec_a %*% vec_b


```
